I've started getting into Local LLMs. I have a feeling I'm going down a rabbit hole I won't recover from.

For now, I want to turn a spare computer into a 24/7 local LLM and FTP server available on my network. I think that'd be fun

After that, it'd be awesome to fine-tune some models to host on this website. A model trained on my career to answer career/portfolio questions, a model trained on my projects to answer questions and cite code, a model trained on my blog posts to generate new blogs to answer website visitor questions

So much to do! How exciting!
