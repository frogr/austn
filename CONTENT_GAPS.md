# Content Gaps to Fill

Hi Austin! I've updated your website with more authentic, human-oriented content based on your resume. Here are the remaining items that need your input to make the site truly yours:

## 1. Profile Picture
- **Location**: AboutMe.jsx (line 83-89)
- **Current**: Using a placeholder image URL
- **Need**: A professional but approachable headshot of you
- **Suggestion**: Something that shows your personality - not too corporate, maybe at your desk or with your dev setup?

## 2. Featured Blog Post Image
- **Location**: AboutMe.jsx (line 28)
- **Current**: Placeholder image for "Why I Pair Program with Claude" post
- **Need**: Screenshot or graphic related to AI pair programming
- **Suggestion**: Screenshot of a Claude conversation, or a stylized code editor with AI suggestions

## 3. Project Screenshots/Demos
Several projects need visual content:

### Pages AI Assistant
- **Need**: Screenshot of the AI assistant in action at CompanyCam
- **Alternative**: Mockup showing natural language to document generation

### Hub - Rails Starter Kit
- **Need**: Screenshot of the boilerplate in action or the landing page
- **Alternative**: Code snippet showing your preferred patterns

### AI Experiments Lab
- **Need**: Screenshots of TodayIn3Minutes, gitRAG, or Overcommunicator
- **Alternative**: Your YouTube channel thumbnail or video screenshot

### Backlit Platform Suite
- **Need**: Any non-confidential screenshot from the TV production tools
- **Alternative**: Logo or stylized graphic representing the entertainment industry

## 4. Blog Content
- **Current**: Only showing one placeholder blog post
- **Suggestions for posts**:
  1. "Why I Pair Program with Claude" (already referenced)
  2. "Teaching Code: What Lambda School Taught Me About Learning"
  3. "From CSM to Developer: How I Mentored Someone Into Tech"
  4. "Building for the Oscars During COVID: A Rails Story"
  5. "The VEST Framework: Making Tech Debt Visible"

## 5. Tech Setup Page
- **Location**: Referenced at `/tech-setup`
- **Need**: Your actual development setup
- **Content ideas**:
  - Hardware: Machine specs, monitors, keyboard/mouse
  - Software: Editor (Cursor?), terminal setup, key extensions
  - AI Tools: How you use Claude, OpenAI, any special workflows
  - Quirky additions: Standing desk? Rubber ducks? Coffee setup?

## 6. Project Details Pages
Each project link needs a dedicated page with:
- Problem statement
- Your approach/solution
- Technical challenges overcome
- Impact/results with real metrics
- Code snippets or architecture diagrams (where appropriate)

## 7. Contact Preferences
- **Current**: Using hi@austn.net everywhere
- **Confirm**: Is this your preferred professional email?
- **LinkedIn**: Need to verify your LinkedIn URL is correct
- **GitHub**: Currently showing as 'frogr' - is this your main account?

## 8. Personal Touches
To make it more "you":
- **Favorite quote about code/development** (besides the one I added)
- **Side interests**: Gaming? Teaching? Open source contributions?
- **Your "why"**: What drives you in development beyond the technical?
- **Fun fact**: Something unexpected that makes you memorable

## 9. Testimonials/Social Proof
Consider adding:
- Quote from a colleague at CompanyCam about the Pages AI project
- Feedback from someone you mentored
- Client testimonial from Backlit or BGCA
- Screenshot of a particularly good PR review or code contribution

## 10. "Currently Building" Section
Your resume mentions:
- TodayIn3Minutes
- gitRAG
- Overcommunicator

Need more details on what these are and their current status.

## Quick Fixes Needed:
1. Verify all internal links work (I created several `/projects/*` routes that need pages)
2. Add actual GitHub activity if you want to show recent commits
3. Update the "Activity" section with real recent work
4. Consider adding metrics/badges (GitHub stars, npm downloads, etc.)

## Notes on the Tone:
I've tried to make your content:
- More conversational and human (less corporate speak)
- Showing personality (mentions of being "oddball", building things "your way")
- Emphasizing your teaching/mentoring passion
- Highlighting your AI-forward approach
- Including subtle humor ("because Jumpstart was too mainstream")

Let me know if any of this doesn't feel authentic to you, and we can adjust!
